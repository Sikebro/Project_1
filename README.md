Kaggle Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/airbnb-listings-reviews/data

In this project, we used a dataset that includes airbnb data for 10 major cities across the world. We analyized the relationship between number of amenities & listing price, new hosts during and before the pandemic, host tenure in comparision to reviews and also analyzed if there was any correlation between listing price and proximity to two major tourist attractions.

In conclusion, we found that there was a pretty substantial drop in new hosts during the pandemic in comparison to the two periods of time prior, we also found that the two most popular places to host are Istanbul & Paris and Istanbul had the most new listings during the Pandemic.  We found that price didn't seem to have any weight on proximity. Affordable Airbnbs are available near popular tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and Times Square. Also, when analyzing the relationship between amenities listed per Airbnb and listing price, we found that there is almost no correlation. There's many Airbnbs with listing prices that are extremely high in comparision to the amenities offered. However, other factors can also affect listing price, such as the location or the type of accommodation.
